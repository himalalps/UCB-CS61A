# corrections

1. the `cats.zip` fall 2022 semester misses a `gui_files` directory which is included in the [fall 2020 version](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa20/proj/cats/cats.zip), meanwhile the `cat_gui.py` has some errors which have been corrected in this repository.

# troubles

1. fa22/week10/lab09 Q2
2. project 4 challenge version seems a lot different from normal version, because it is not a completed skeleton
